41001	Diplomacy System Tutorial
41002	Welcome to the AI Diplomacy Tutorial.
41003	This tutorial will teach you how to use the FXmod's Diplomacy System. If you are lost at any point during this tutorial, please see the [OBJECTIVES] window. Click [OK] to begin.#+
41004	The AI Diplomacy System is used to interact with CPU players in Offline gameplay modes. To see how this can be useful, let's take a look at the following situation:
41005	An enemy has deployed a powerful fleet before us. We have a good amount of RUs, but our Carrier is not ready for unit production.
41006	Luckily, we have an allied player. They have the means to build ships, but are low on resources. If we give them some of our RUs, they may be able to help us out.
41007	First, open the Diplomacy Window by pressing your [K] button, or clicking the Diplomacy button in the left sidebar on your screen.
41008	Transfer RUs to ally
41009	Use the Diplomacy System to transfer 8000 RUs to your Taiidan ally.\n1. Open Diplomacy System (hotkey: [K])\n2. Select Taiidan player, click [Open Communicator]\n3. Use the [I'd like to have an exchange with you] option to gift him 8000 RUs, and reach 80 reputation.
41010	This is the Diplomacy Window. The game is automatically paused while it is open, so rest assured.
41011	The left window shows all players currently in the game. Friendly or Allied players start with a Relationship level of "0"; enemy players are always set to "-100".
41012	To continue, select the Taiidan player with 0 Reputation, and click [Open Communicator] in the right window.
41013	Now navigate to the [I'd like to have an exchange with you] option, and choose [I'd like to give you some RUs].
41014	Use the [I'd like to give you some RUs] option to transfer 8000 RUs to our ally (=80 Reputation).
41015	Good job. You can now close the Diplomacy Window: click any player in the left window, and press [K]. Or click the [Close Communicator] button.
41016	Thanks for the RUs, we have heard of your situation and will commission a fleet to assist you.
41017	It seems we have left a favorable impression with our ally. This is shown via the Reputation we have with them.
41018	Reputation works much like a currency. It can be earned and spent in various ways. Important to remember is: The more reputation you have with an allied player, the more influence you will have over them.
41019	We will use our good standing with our ally to call for a strike on the enemy fleet. This option is unlocked by reaching 80 reputation.
41020	Open up the Communicator again by pressing [K], and select our Taiidan ally. This time, choose the [I'd like to discuss tactics with you] option, and call for a strike.
41021	Call a Strike
41022	Request your ally to send in a fleet to attack.\n1. Open Diplomacy System (hotkey: [K])\n2. Select Taiidan player, click [Open Communicator].\n3. Choose the [I'd like to discuss tactics with you] option and call for a strike.
41023	Great work. Do you still remember how to close the Diplomacy Window? Click any player in the left window, and press [K] or click [Close Communicator].
41024	The enemy fleet is distracted! We can use this chance to strike at the enemy's Mothership. 
41025	Destroy the Enemy Mothership
41026	Join with the allied fleet and destroy the enemy ships, or use the distraction to head straight for their Mothership and take it out.
41027	Sensors detect there still is an enemy production vessel left somewhere. But with their main fleet destroyed, they may be inclined to surrender. It would save us some time.
41028	Open the Diplomacy System one last time ([K]). This time, select the enemy Kadeshi player, and offer them to surrender by assuring their safety.
41029	Force Surrender
41030	Use the Diplomacy System to offer the enemy Kadesh player a surrender.\n1. Open Diplomacy System (hotkey: [K])\n2. Select Kadeshi player, click [Open Communicator]\n3. Offer a surrender, and promise their safety.
41031	Good job. Word of our mercy will surely spread throughout this quadrant of the galaxy.
41032	This concludes the Diplomacy System tutorial. There are many more options, like player missions you can complete for Reputation. As you play and experiment, you will discover new pathways to victory. Good luck!
41033	Kadeshi Fleet
41034	Our patrol fleet has returned. Use it to reinforce our allies, or move straight for and destroy enemy's Mothership while its fleet is distracted.
41035	Enemy Mothership
