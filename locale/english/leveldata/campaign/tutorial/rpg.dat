80000	Calf Manaan's Cargo Ship
80001	What else is here besides garbage!
80002	Emergency Channel Receives Communication!Emergency Channel Receives Communication!
80003	Er... Okay, open it.
80004	Hello? Anybody? I'm Calf Manaan. My cargo ship can't move. Please help me. I'll attach the coordinates to the end of the communication.
80005	Aha! A poor fish. Still better than me... He has a cargo ship!
80006	Okay, let me see...
80007	Found you...You should be glad I'm nearby.
80008	Holy Sajuuk! Is that a ship... Or shit?
80009	Eh... Eh ah ah ah...
80010	What is hyperspace core? Why did progenitor civil war break out?
80011	Thank goodness, someone's here!
80012	Well, hello, worker there. Can you help me repair this god damn ship?
80013	Somehow she suddenly refused to move.
80014	If this 'shit' can move, I would be really surprised.
80015	Hey, I know my ship is in very bad shape, but all my belongings are on it. Would you please do me a favor and repair it?
80016	Give me a reason to help you repair the ship first?
80017	Start taking advantage of the fire, huh? Well, as long as my ship can move again, I'll give you 2000 funds.
80018	That's generous... Hard to refuse.
80019	So let's start. Time is precious to me.
80020	Um... There is a problem.
80021	No one can repair a ship without high strength alloy.
80022	Take this, that's the last thing I need on board.
80023	Move to the crate, and select to pick it up.
80024	So, you're a ship repairman?
80025	During the war, yes. Now? Just collecting debris.
80026	Ah, yeah, debris... What a terrible war...
80027	Cleaning them up is even more terrible. There are fragmented corpses everywhere.
80028	Think about the good things. Debris are treasure all over.
80029	You kidding. I see only a pile of scrap iron.
80030	My friend, if you've been to Karos or Abbasid, you won't say that.
80031	Abbasid... Progenitor debris zone... You've been there before?
80032	Just returned.
80033	Wow, what did you find? Found any treasure?
80034	I found... shit!
80035	...
80036	Are you sure your repairs are up to standard?
80037	Repair procedures are fully automatic, and your ship will soon be able to move smoothly.
80038	If I'm reading it right... The reactors are overloading!
80039	What! How is that possible?
80040	The temperature is rising rapidly. This ship is about to explode!
80041	Oh, damn it!
80042	Leave the cargo ship as soon as possible
80043	Damn! Calf! Calf Manan!
80044	Computer, lock the escape cabin signal!
80045	Found you.
80046	...
80047	Passed out... Well, he's lucky that he's not dead...
80048	He said he had just returned from Abbasid... 
80049	There must be something good on board... Yes, must be!
80050	Wait a sec. What's this...
80051	Oh, shit!
80052	Garbage...
80053	Garbage...
80054	Garbage everywhere!
80055	Garbage...
80056	Garbage...
80057	Garbage everywhere!
80058	I think I should take my container with me... Just in case.
80059	Ha! My container, better take it with me, just in case...
80060	After selecting the worker, right-click the container to carry it.
80061	Calf Manaan
80062	Well, everything is ready now.
80063	Biological awakening signals were detected...
80064	Wh... What the hell?!
80065	Biology: Hiigaran, Male. Consciousness: 86%
80066	What the hell, did my onboard computer went mad?
80067	Rationality: 78%, speakable... Hello, my name is Nyacens. Please give me more advice.
80068	You... Ny...
80069	Nya... cen, my name is Nyacens.
80070	Where did you come from? What did you do to my onboard computer?!
80071	My former master, Calf Manaan, transplanted me to your ship in return for saving him.
80072	Right... That captain... Where is he?
80073	Former master has already left, saying that he should hasten to revitalize the lost business and return the 2000 funds owed to you in the future.
80074	What a reputable Manaan... Wait, he's your... Master?
80075	He is my former master, my present master... Is you.
80076	No no no no no... master or something... Even if you are mine now... No no no no... You can just call me...
80077	Enter your name:
80078	So, what on earth are you? AI? I really haven't seen such a smart AI, military model? Can't you be contraband?
80079	If by your definition... I'm an advanced AI.
80080	Holy Sajuuk, I only heard that the military AI and the civil AI recently developed by Kiith S'jet for large ships and large enterprises, they both have sky-high prices. So, are you military or civilian?
80081	I don't know... I was picked up by my former master from a place called Abbasid, things before that... [BEEP: MEMORY READING ERROR]... I can't remember it.
80082	Abbasid debris zone? So what Calf found there is you! Then you... are you... made by progenitors?
80083	Progenitor? What's that?
80084	That's the civilization existed in this galaxy thousands of years ago. Science and technology are much more advanced than we are now. The hyperspace core is built by them... 
80085	... Can you study by yourself? I am not a professor of history... Here is our capital, Hiigara. The network signal is absolutely full. Wait a minute. How did we get to Hiigara?
80086	After my former master transplanted me to this ship, I worked out an autonomous navigation plan based on the star map.
80087	What?! Good heavens... MY SHIP...
80088	... [SEARCHING]... Nearby Nabaal Orbital Shipyard provides maintenance services for the Hiigara standard ships.
80089	A quick learner, Eh? Now search for "General Rules for the Operation of Civil Ships in Hiigara". Before finishing learning, don't touch my ship again!
80090	... Ok... [SEARCHING]... Learning complete. Shall I drive the ship to Nabaal Orbital Shipyard now?
80091	No way! I will do it myself!
80092	... Okay, from here, you can go straight to the orbital shipyard through the nearby tunnel gate.
80093	Ah, ah... Calf... You meant it, didn't you!
80094	... I haven't come to such a busy place to repair my tiny ship. What should I do, Nyacens?
80095	Select the ship that needs to be repaired, click "manage", then click "repair".
80096	It's too expensive. I'm really out of money now. The fuel is not even enough for picking up garbage.
80097	If you want to make money, there will be some procurement tasks for us in the nearby star areas. We can also buy goods at low prices and sell them at high prices between different sites.
80098	Come on... I'm not good at doing business...
80099	Understand... This Hiigara standard worker can also be competent for mining work... The Somtaaw mining station in Jade Snail Nebula seems to need some help...
80100	Er... But now that you are here, let me try to do business.
80101	This is the capital of Hiigara Empire, which has concentrated almost all the industrial chains. Common commodities on the market can be bought here, and the price is close to the average level.
80102	Somtaaw Orbital Refinery sells all kinds of basic materials produced by smelting minerals.
80103	Kaalel Orbital Fabricating Plant uses these raw materials to process some basic industrial products.
80104	Manaan Orbital Trading Station sells all kinds of goods produced on the planet and imports all the goods needed by the planet.
80105	Naabal Orbital Shipyard undertakes orders for various Hiigaran ships and is responsible for the security of the area.
80106	Star gates lead to other areas nearby, through which more space stations can be accessed.
80107	Okay... I see. Let's get started.
80108	Click on the "Objectives" button to get tasks posted in the local star area.
80109	It is said that their warships are operated by AI... But the progenitor empire collapsed and perished in a civil war...
80110	However, this ship's power system is too low, and the extra load brought by the container further reduces its conventional speed. In order to arrive as soon as possible, I overloaded the engine power to 125%.
