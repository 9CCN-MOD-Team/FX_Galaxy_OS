  	text = [[<b>Kadesh</b>

The Kadeshi are a strikecraft faction that rely on numbers, burst damage, and survivability. Fast, cheap ships, but limited (anti)-Capital Ship options makes them exceed at early to midgame. The Kadeshi are straightforward to play, but need some micromanagement to truly get the most of them.

<b>Unique/Key Units</b>

Aberrance Swarmer, Support Pod, Nebula (Bright/Dark), Nagual, Araneid, Fuel Pod

<b>Playing as Kadeshi</b>

Fast, earlygame raids against nearby enemy RU Operations and Subsystems will give you an edge for the rest of the match. Invest in Fuel Pods to outsource strikecraft production, and bring Support Pods with your swarms for when you need that extra damage. 

The Nagual will keep enemy strikecraft at bay, allowing you to build up a wing of Adv.Assault Swarmers/Multi-Beam Frigates to accompany the Bright Nebula on the final push.

<b>Playing vs. Kadeshi</b>

The Khar-Toba (Carrier) is your top priority target - it houses all Kadeshi technology, and supplies most of their unit abilities. Later in the match, track down the Dark Nebula first to reveal it.

Dedicated anti-strikecraft Corvettes and Frigates can tame a Kadeshi swarm with numbers, and Kadeshi Frigates/Capital Ships, while powerful, are weakly armored. Move-attack orders will help.]]

  	text = [[[Progenitors</b>

The Progenitors are a (ranged) Capital Ship annex Production faction, with powerful but slow ships, and a slow start but an unmatched potential at lategame. With unique versions of the Scout and the Probe, as well as the Balcora Gate¡¯s [Ping] ability at lategame, they also exceed in intel.

<b>Unique/Key Units</b>

Partner, Arbitrator, Keeper, Phase Prism, Arsenal Ship, Balcora Gate, Phased Probe.

<b>Playing as Progenitor</b>

Use Light Movers/Movers or rely on aid from your allies to survive the slow start. Setup enough RU operations, and invest in additional production vessels for a steady swarm of Frigates and Keepers with Arbitrators, or tech up and take out enemies from a far with the mighty Arsenal Ship. 

The Dreadnaught and Sajuuk can force a victory at lategame, but beware - you will still lose if you have no production vessels left.

<b>Playing vs. Progenitor</b>

Try to take out the Balcora Gate as soon as possible - or at least before it can get the Dreadnaught out. It is visible to anyone on the map, and cannot be rebuilt, hardcapping the Progenitors on their current technology level. 

Tracking down and destroying their Pyramids will further delay or collapse their technology. As with any production-oriented faction, destroying their RU Collectors will also hit them hard.]]
