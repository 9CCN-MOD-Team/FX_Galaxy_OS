80000	Calf Manaan's Cargo Ship
80001	What else is here besides garbage!
80002	Emergency Channel Receives Communication! Emergency Channel Receives Communication!
80003	Er... Okay, open it.
80004	Hello? Anybody? I'm Calf Manaan. My cargo ship won't move. Please help me! I'll attach the coordinates to the end of the transmission.
80005	Aha! A poor fish. Still, he's better off than me... He has a cargo ship!
80006	Okay, let me see...
80007	Found you...You should be glad I'm nearby.
80008	Holy Sajuuk! Is that a ship... or shit?
80009	Eh... Eh ah ah ah...
80010	What is \"Hyperspace Core\"? Why did the Progenitor civil war break out?
80011	Thank goodness, someone's here!
80012	Well, hello, worker there. Can you help me repair this god damn ship?
80013	Somehow she suddenly refused to move.
80014	If this junk can move, I would be really surprised.
80015	Hey, I know my ship is in very bad shape, but all my belongings are on it. Would you please do me a favor and repair it?
80016	Give me a reason to help you repair the ship first?
80017	Taking advantage of the fire, huh? How about this, if my ship can move again I'll give you 2000 funds.
80018	That's generous... Hard to refuse.
80019	So let's start. Time is precious to me.
80020	Um... There is a problem.
80021	No one can repair a ship without High-Strength Alloy.
80022	Take this, that's the last thing I need on board.
80023	Move to the crate, and click on it to pick it up.
80024	So, you're a ship repairman?
80025	During the war, yes. Now? Just collecting debris.
80026	Ah, yeah, debris... What a terrible war...
80027	Cleaning them up is even more terrible. There are fragmented corpses everywhere.
80028	Think about the good things. Debris is treasure all over.
80029	You're kidding me. I only see a pile of scrap iron.
80030	My friend, if you've been to Karos or Abassid, you won't say that.
80031	Abassid... Progenitor debris zone... You've been there before?
80032	Just returned.
80033	Wow, what did you find? Found any treasure?
80034	I found... shit!
80035	...
80036	Hey, are you sure your repairs are up to the standard?
80037	Repair procedures are fully automatic, and your ship will soon be able to move smoothly.
80038	If I'm reading it right... The reactors are overloading!
80039	What! How is that possible?
80040	The temperature is rising rapidly. The ship is about to explode!
80041	Oh, damn it!
80042	Leave the cargo ship as soon as possible
80043	Damn! Calf! Calf Manaan!
80044	Computer, track the escape pod signal!
80045	Found you... let's get you aboard.
80046	...
80047	Passed out... Well, he's lucky that he's not dead.
80048	Hmm...he did say he had just returned from Abassid... 
80049	There must be something good on board... Yes, there must be!
80050	Wait a sec. What's this...
80051	Oh, shit!
80052	Garbage...
80053	Garbage...
80054	Garbage everywhere!
80055	Garbage...
80056	Garbage...
80057	Garbage everywhere!
80058	I think I should take my container with me... Just in case.
80059	Ha! My container, better take it with me, just in case...
80060	After selecting the worker, right-click the container to carry it.
80061	Calf Manaan
80062	Well, everything is ready now.
80063	Biological awakening signals detected...
80064	Wh-... What the hell?!
80065	Biology: Hiigaran, Male. Consciousness: 86%.
80066	What the hell, did my onboard computer go mad?
80067	Rationality: 78%, conversation possible... Hello, my name is Nyacens. Please give me more advice.
80068	You... Ny...
80069	Nya... cen, my name is Nyacens.
80070	Where did you come from? What did you do to my onboard computer?!
80071	My former master, Calf Manaan, transplanted me to your ship in return for saving him.
80072	Right... That captain... Where is he?
80073	Former master has already left, saying that he should hasten to revitalize the lost business and return the 2000 funds owed to you in the future.
80074	What a reputable Manaan... Wait, he's your... Master?
80075	He is my former master, my present master... Is you.
80076	Wh- No no no, wait a second ... "master"  or something... Even if you are mine now... no no no, you can just call me...
80077	Enter your name:
80078	So, what in Kharak's name are you? AI? I really haven't seen such a smart AI before..a secret prototype? Were you smuggled out from a lab?
80079	Assessing vocabulary...going by your definition, I am an advanced AI.
80080	Holy Sajuuk, I only know the basic military and civil AIs recently developed by Kiith S'jet for large ships and enterprises, and they both have sky-high prices... So, are you military or civilian?
80081	I don't know... I was picked up by former master from a place called Abassid, things before that... [BEEP: -MEMORY READING ERROR-]... I can't remember it.
80082	Abassid debris zone? So what Calf found there was you! Then you... Are you... a Progenitor construct?
80083	Progenitor? What's that?
80084	That's the civilization that existed in this galaxy thousands of years ago. Their science and technology are still much more advanced than ours now. The hyperspace cores were built by them... 
80085	... Can you study by yourself? I am not a professor of history... Here is our capital, Hiigara. The network signal is absolutely full. Wait a minute, how did we get to Hiigara?
80086	After my former master transplanted me to this ship, I worked out an autonomous navigation plan based on the star map.
80087	What?! Good heavens... MY SHIP...
80088	... [SEARCHING]... Nearby Nabaal Orbital Shipyard provides maintenance services for the Hiigara standard ships.
80089	A quick learner, eh? Now search for "General Rules for the Operating of Civil Ships in Hiigara". And until you finish learning, don't touch my ship again!
80090	... Ok... [PROCESSING]... Learning complete. Shall I drive this ship to Nabaal Orbital Shipyard now?
80091	Wh- No way! I will do it myself!
80092	... Understood, from here you can go straight to the orbital shipyard via the nearby tunnel gate.
80093	Ah, ah... Calf... you were serious, weren't you!
80094	... I haven't come to such a busy place just to repair my tiny ship. What should I do, Nyacens?
80095	Select the ship that needs to be repaired, click "[Manage]", then click "[Repair]".
80096	It's too expensive, I'm really out of money now! The leftover fuel is not even enough for picking up garbage.
80097	If you want to make money, there will be some procurement tasks for us in the nearby star systems. We can also buy goods at low prices and sell them at high prices between different sites.
80098	Come on... I'm not good at doing business...
80099	Understood... as a Hiigara standard worker, this vessel is also suited to mining work... The Somtaaw Mining Station in Jade Snail Nebula seems to need some help...
80100	Err... But now that you are here, let me try to do business.
80101	This is the capital of the Hiigaran Empire, which has a high concentrated of almost all the industries. Common commodities on the market can be bought here, and the price is close to the average level.
80102	Somtaaw Orbital Refinery sells all kinds of raw materials produced by smelting minerals.
80103	Kaalel Orbital Fabricating Plant processes these raw materials into some basic industrial products.
80104	Manaan Orbital Trading Station sells all kinds of goods produced on the planet, and imports the goods needed by the planet.
80105	Naabal Orbital Shipyard takes construction orders for various Hiigaran ships, and is responsible for the security of the area.
80106	Star gates lead to nearby systems, through which more space stations can be accessed.
80107	Okay... I see. Let's get started.
80108	Click on the "[Objectives]" button to get tasks posted in the local area.
80109	It is said that their warships are operated by AI... But the Progenitor Empire collapsed and perished in a civil war...
80110	However, this ship's power system is too low, and the extra load brought by the container further reduces its conventional speed. In order to arrive as soon as possible, I overloaded the engine power to 125%.
