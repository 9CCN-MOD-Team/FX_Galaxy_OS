40751	Scans negative.
40752	Point verified, nothing in range.
40753	No contacts acquired.
40754	Sanctuary of Lir'Zha
40755	We have arrived at the Sanctuary to look for and assist our sistership. It is currently on patrol in this system together with our main fleet, but is overdue. 
40756	Our sistership will know we have entered their area. Setup preliminary resource operations while we wait for them to contact us. 
40757	T-2 intervals have passed, no contact acquired. Standby.
40758	The main frequencies remain silent, but our Listeners confirm no emergency signals linger in the vicinity. Our sistership is probably laying in wait near a target again. The current situation bears consistent with the past.
40759	Our sistership's navigation plan is being projected. Send units ahead to these known contact points, and establish a positive ID.
40760	Picking up something, commencing analysis.
40761	It appears to be a beacon signal. Reading is a little faint, but the frequencies match. It's ours.
40762	We have narrowed its location down to this position. 
40763	Dispatch a team to verify the source of the signal.
40764	 ... ...
40765	 ... ...
40766	Positive ID established. Ship markings are a match, they are part of our sistership's fleet. However, we are unable to verify the contents of their transmission due to apparent interference.
40767	We will attempt a direct link. Advance the mothership to within their transmission range, and retry communication.
40768	 ... ...
40769	 ... ... 
40770	It appears we are still unable to establish communications..but we have received a text message on our open channel. 
40771	The message reads that they were hit by an electromagnetic storm. Their communications equipment has been down since. As per instructions, they stayed behind to fix it while the rest of the fleet went on ahead.
40772	The message also confirms that the main fleet including our sistership is in good health. It appears they indeed found a large prey, and are waiting for us to join them at the attached coordinates.
40773	Navigation has established our destination. It appears they are laying in wait near this debris field. Advance the fleet, and standby for rendezvous with our main force.
40774	Additional message received. Our allies confirm repairs are proceeding smoothly. They hope to join up with us momentarily.
40775	Lady Nagual, pray take mercy..
40776	Coordinates confirm that we have indeed arrived at the site, but uh . . we are not seeing or reading any signs of our sistership and her fleet .. and yet our Listeners claim that we uh- are in fact right next to them..!
40777	..Begin scans immediately, see if-
40778	Picking up energy signatures...we have hostiles! Close range, multiple!
40779	..Confirmed! Defend the mothership!
40780	Hostiles cleansed. Situation under control. Standby.
40781	..Our sistership has been destroyed. Scans taken during the battle have returned a 86.2% match with the debris around us. Segments of our main fleet were also identified.
40782	Grief and questions remain. But right now we must endure. We owe it to those we still carry with us...now more than ever.
40783	We should check back with the detached unit we encountered previously. Their safety aside, their logs and databanks might help us deduct what happened here. Dispatch a unit to inform them, and guide them to the mothership.
40784	Our Listeners report that particularly strong traces of our sisterstip still linger in this area. Some useful components might have survived the explosion.
40785	Recommend exploring and harvesting the debris around us. Larger segments of wreckage may hold things that can aid in our survival. Our Salvage crews are en-route to assist.
40786	Search Team. We have identified one of our sistership's main modules amidst the debris. It is damaged, but mostly intact. Engineering may be able to graft it onto the mothership.
40787	New build option available.
40788	Search team. We have located an intact Fuel Pod. It has been ID'ed as part of our main fleet. Seems to have malfunctioned and drifted off. The wreckage probably helped it avoid detection.
40789	The vessel itself is beyond repairs, but we have uncovered several Swarmers. We are rerouting power to the hangar and transferring crews to activate their remote follow function.
40790	This is squadron D3 to allied fleet. The main force was ambushed, all hands KIA. We have come to secure you.
40791	... ...
40792	Repeat, we have come to ensure your safety. Please assume formation and follow us to the mothership immediately.
40793	... ...
40794	?.huh, how did you survive that, I wonder?
40795	..?! Taking friendly fire! Stay clear fleet, stay-
40796	Warning, we have lost contact with our forward units. Last they reported was that our allied unit has gone rogue..!
40797	Bridge, this is Assault Team 1. We have been listening in and are aware of the situation.
40798	Now that things have come to this we believe the only way is to get some answers from the crew themselves. They may be being held hostage. Requesting permission to dispatch and board the rogue vessel.
40799	We assure the safety of any non-combatants. Please give us the order.
40800	..Granted. We will prepare an Armed Infiltrate Pod to carry your team there. May the Martyrs of the Garden guide and absolve us all.
40801	The bridge is coming within view.
40802	We've almost got it.
40803	Alert, communications with our Assault Team were cut off. The rogue unit has vanished from sensors..! Assault Team, if you read this: come in.
40804	...
40805	Repeat. Assault Team, come in. Do you read?
40806	...
40807	..this is the acting commander for Team 1, copy. The rogue vessel self-destructed before I could cross over. Casualties over 85%, unable to maintain operations..making our final run.
40808	Good to have you still with us. What happened?
40809	...They were not ours, Jihr-sa. Our teams reported that numerous dead bodies were strewn across the vessel's interior. Its present crew was heavily armed and clad in protective gear.
40810	...It seems they were boarded prior to our arrival. The vessel's new crew then lured us into that ambush. We were unable to ascertain their affiliation.
40811	However, while the datalink was active we got a brief glimpse into the vessel's systems. It appears our sistership had intel on increasing Turanic Raider activity in this region. But in the end, something ambushed them before they saw chance to transmit or even register their findings.
40812	We are alone. Group our units around the mothership, and be prepared for anything while we discuss the next course of action.
40813	We must find out more before we share in our sistership's fate. There is no guarantee that an ambush fleet isn’t already waiting for us back where we came from, or is encroaching on us as we speak.
40814	Visuals confirmed..
40815	They first came and took away our identity. And now yet again the Sajiikrit encroach, defiling what remains in their endless greed. This cannot come to pass.
40816	Destroy the invading fleets and their commanding vessels. None are to escape.
40817	The mothership will perform a short-range jumps to bring us within striking distance. We can utilize this function to trap them and reinforce the offensive.
40819	All targets have been destroyed.
40820	We have avenged our brethren, but we cannot ignore the facts. The Sanctuary has been breached. Soon the Sajiikrit will return, and in their wake more will follow. ...This place is no longer safe.
40821	With our sistership and main fleet lost we no longer have the means to stop them. As painful as it is, we have to flee. ..Again.
40822	As painful as it is, we must protect those who survived today and we carry with us. Their descendants are all who can carry on our legacy..and our will.
40823	Setup Resourcing
40824	The area around us is rich in resources. Setup preliminary resource operations while we wait for our sistership to contact us.
40825	Contact Point
40826	Locate the Fleet
40827	Dispatch units to our sistership's known contact points and find a lead on its whereabouts.
40828	Head deeper into the Sanctuary
40829	Still nothing, adjusting onboard sensors..
40830	Head deeper into the Sanctuary
40831	Establish Communications
40832	Verify the source of the allied signal and establish communications with it.
40833	Allied Contact
40834	Advance the mothership
40835	Rally Point
40836	Rally Point - Advance the Mothership
40837	Secure the Allied Unit
40838	Secure the Allied Unit
40839	Our detached unit must be informed about what happened to our sistership and placed under our protection at once. Dispatch units to establish contact, and escort them to the mothership.
40840	Capture the Rogue Vessel
40841	Dispatch an Armed Infiltrate Pod to board and capture the rogue Support Pod. 
40842	The rogue Support Pod was destroyed...we no longer have a means to find out what happened here.
40843	Sensors indicate that the rogue unit is calling for reinforcements. If we delay too long our advantage will be forfeit.
40844	Investigate the Wrecksite
40845	Larger segments of the debris around us are returning faint echoes. Dispatch units to check for any commodities that may have survived the blast.
40846	Derelict module installed. New build and research options available. Crews are now working on merging the more advanced systems with our own, but have reported this will take time. 
40847	Search team. We have located several crates that appear be RU containers. Some of them are still intact. 
40848	This debris is completely scorched. The concentrations of these fields suggest that our sistership broke apart under tremendous firepower. It must have been instantaneous.
40849	Our search teams report all wrecksites have processed.
40850	Escape the Sanctuary
40851	Destroy the invading fleets and their commanding vessels, and escape the Sanctuary before reinforcements arrive.
40855	Detached Unit
40856	Rogue Fleet
40857	MEMORY SYNCHRONIZATION FAILED
40858	MISSION COMPLETE
40859	Ambush Fleet
40860	Sanctuary Invader
40861	Sanctuary Invader
40862	The Kushan passage through the Nebula has left the Kadeshi on the verge of extinction.
40863	No more than a few scattered contacts escaped the ordeal, having been too far away to join the main fleet in time.
40864	The survivors banded together and disappeared into the Nebula, hiding from the eyes of time.
40865	In time, the last of their resources, manpower and technologies were funnelled into the creation of two final motherships.
40866	Grief eventually faded. But what came to replace it would stir the galaxy for generations to come.
40867	They are not powering down or responding to hails. What has come over them?
40868	Today we leave the last segment of our ancient home. But as we run, we will hunt. We will survive. We will avenge. And one day, our descendants will return..and, ultimately, reclaim.
40869	Capture the Rogue Unit
40870	Derelict Vessel
40871	One of our Salvagers attempted to commit sacrilege. All working crews are reminded that only physical surfaces are eligible for resource extraction.
40872	These resource pockets have been depleted. Strange, the ship on patrol duty always carries the majority of our fleet's resources with it. That way it doesn't have to rely on any on-site procurement.
40873	We are taking heavy fire. Scramble Araneids to assist with repairs.
40874	Friendly Swarmers launching from the derelict Fuel Pod.
40878	We have marked down their location for retrieval. Sending the data now.
40879	An enemy carrier is retreating. It must be destroyed before it can escape.
40880	It was decided that an immediate escape from the Sanctuary is in order. The fastest way out is through this area. The goddesses' veins run thick here; any heathen units that might have invaded the Sanctuary are likely to be within.
40881	Our crews have reported new build options are available. Dispatch Scanner Probes to the areas ahead. All hands are to remain at maximum alert.
40882	Dispatch Probes
40883	Secure our escape route, deploy Probes to the Nebulae ahead to see if any other enemy units have infiltrated the Sanctuary. 
40884	Our Listeners have reported that the enemy Resource Collectors are slowing down. The enemy fleets must be preparing to withdraw. We are running out of time.
40885	Dispatch a Probe
40886	Enemy Carrier
40887	Found Ally
40888	Defeat Ambush
40889	Support Pod Captured
40890	Understood. Hold position.
40891	Exit Point
40892	Enemy Rally Point
