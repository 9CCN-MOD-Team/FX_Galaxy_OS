40600	Karos Outskirts - Unexplored Area
40601	The Karos Graveyard stirs with a renewed interest after the Vaygr war.
40602	After the Hiigarans' ceasefire pact many have ventured into Karos, now an open zone, hoping to obtain their shares of the Age of Discovery.
40603	Pressure especially is on the Turanic Raiders, whose ongoing fleet overhaul and colonization efforts have created a mounting need for usable wreckage.
40605	Most of Karos' more central areas have been completely excavated by now. But secrets still lurk in some of the lesser, more remote sectors...
40606	Range jump successful. Verifying coordinates..check, we have arrived at the target site.
40607	While faint, initial sensor sweeps are returning echoes from the nearby dustbanks.
40608	Begin exploring our surroundings, see if there is anything worthwhile out there as we prep the working crews.
40609	Our Escort Team has confirmed they are en-route, and will be arriving shortly.
40610	This is Reckon1. All target sites in the vicinity have been processed. Negative, captain. Nothing new from our previous report. Standing by.
40611	Copy that reckon. We'll just grab whatever we can from here before we venture deeper. Working teams, standby to deploy.
40612	Reckon, this is Scrapper J2. Can you confirm there are no active defenses at these sites?
40613	Got you J2, affirmative. Nothing here but scraps and dust.
40614	Copy that. First time we don't have some automata trying to blast us to scrap from the get-go..not sure what to think about this.
40615	Come here often?
40616	Eighth time now..never really get used to it though. Jobs like these make you appreciate the hauling work back at the base a lot more.
40618	You got that right.
40619	Escort Team, this is the Bridge. We're picking up a contact in the area ahead. Its reading is weak, but has been consistent. Can you confirm?
40620	This is Heavy Boss. Aye, we see 'er. Might have some uninvited guests here after all. We'll rev up the engines and go take a look.
40621	Be advised, this is uncharted terrority. One of your Scouts can get us more intel without putting whatever may be out there on alert.
40622	Engineering has confirmed construction bays C through F are now online. We also have full power to engines.
40623	Dustbins are available for construction. Recommend deploying them to increase harvesting efficiency.
40625	This is reckon "Deep Eagle" to base. Picking up some faint com chatter...it appears to be a Kadeshi fleet. 
40626	Doesn't seem like they've noticed us yet. Will keep you advised.
40627	We are currently in no position for a direct assault. Stay clear and focus on our resourcing operations for the time being.
40628	This is Engineering Team Echo 2. We have power to all smaller systems, on-board researching is coming online and will be set to go momentarily.
40630	New research and build options now available. 
40631	Deep Eagle to base. Err...looks like we've got have their attention now! Additional contacts inbound, there's a number of mass signatures matching Frigate-sized vessels among them. 
40632	Understood Deep Eagle. Attention crew, the warmup is over. All hands to combat stations, set bearing to 2-1-2. Hold the perimeter. 
40633	We've got a hyperspace signature..it's a Hiigaran fleet! This could become a real headache.
40634	The Kadeshi are breaking off to engage the Hiigaran fleet. 
40635	Do not pursue. We'll take this chance to rebuild our forces and check on the damage reports. All stations-.
40636	This is Heavy Boss. Combat teams: ahead full. Let's go nab ourselves some bonus pay before these cannons here start rusting from boredom.
40637	Escort Team, you're straying from the perimeter .. what are you doing? Do you know what you're about to get the fleet into?
40638	Going in hot and seizing the spoils while they're still fresh is what defines a TRUE Raider. Your track record is impressive old man, but your age has left you cowering over a bunch of nutcases and some uppity Hiigarans. 
40639	We can't leave those hotheads to themselves out there. Who knows what they will bring upon us. We don't have a choice. Engines: ahead full. 
40640	Bring up the rear and keep an escape route open at all times. If we can't convince them, the firepower being thrown around out there will.
40641	Be advised, stay clear of the combat zone. We won't last long in there.
40643	Something isn't right..we still haven't encountered any defenses this far in. And yet some of that debris ahead dates pretty recent..contact our escorts at once, tell them to get-
40644	Alert, Alert! Contacts inbound, multiple! 
40645	..they are gone. Our Escort Fleet has vanished from radars, all frequencies lost. Reckon, did you get anything?
40646	Uhh..checking the uh- data now...our instruments registered an energy spike right before we lost contact. Readings suggest it may be some sort of EMP..we're not sure.
40647	Mass signatures indicate that our cruiser is still active and moving about slowly, but..it is no longer engaging the other ships, or..or returning any life signs..
40649	Whatever happened out there, we have to assume that our Escort Fleet is lost. We should fall back and rebuild our fleet immediately.
40650	We are counting on the dustclouds near these resources to keep us hidden from .. whatever is out there. Have researching study reckon's data as soon as possible. 
40651	Team Echo 2 reports all remaining systems are go. The main hangar bays are online and researching has full power.
40653	Our Attack Carrier is now operating at full capacity. Frigates are available for construction, but with our escorts lost we can only man a few.
40654	Reckon to Base. We've been picking up an anomalous signal in the region ever since the Kadeshi Needleship vanished from sensors. 
40655	There no way to tell what it is, but it is big. We have narrowed its location down to the vicinity of the former Kadesh site. Suggest.
40656	That anomaly may be what these Kadeshi and Hiigarans were after. If nothing else, it may be a way to ensure we live to tell the tale. 
40657	Recommend investigating the anomaly. Out Scouts' cloak generators will allow them to safely narrow down and pinpoint its location.
40658	This is Reckon1, we've got it captain! Putting it on visuals now ... it's a large derelict ship. 
40659	It looks to be in pretty rough shape. Detecting no power signatures or signals, it's completely offline.
40660	Copy that, reckon. Good work, standby.
40661	The derelict vessel's appearance bears similarities to those units that vanished our escorts. Recommend sending in a team for further investigation.
40662	
40663	
40664	Engineering reports they can retrofit a Siege Drill Frigate to carry our technicians on board the alien ship. Dispatch one immediately, but take all precautions.
40665	We're in. The ship's engines are beyond repairs, but we have found something in its databanks that might prove useful. Sending the data now.
40666	From the derelict vessels, we have learned that this sector of space was once used as a storage site for defunct alien ships. Most of them have broken up further since.
40667	We have been discovered! Sensors indicate all reanimated vessels are closing on our position. All hands to battle stations! ..This will be a tough call.
40668
40669	What the hell was that?
40670	Our cruiser's hull is enveloped in some sort of sustained electromagnetic field. Capturing it will be impossible, we must destroy it!
40671	Begin Exploration
40672	The nearby dustclouds are returning faint echoes. Deploy Scouts and setup preliminary surveillance of the area. 
40673	Engineering reports we have partial power to construction and engines. They are now dispatching to bring the carrier's remaining systems back online. Standby for updates.
40674	This is Heavy Boss entering your perimeter. Kept you waiting ladies. Standing down for escort duty.
40675	Investigate the area
40676	Investigate the area
40677	Investigate the area
40678	Investigate the area
40679	This is Reckon1, status update. There's surprisingly little out here so far..best we got are a few derelict Movers, and not in a condition where they'll help provide for the base upkeep. We'll keep moving and drop beacons as we go, standby. 
40680	Setup Resourcing
40681	Begin retrieval of debris and raw materials from the immediate vicinity. Recommend staying near our Escort Fleet once they have arrived.
40682	H.B., this is Deep Eagle. Picking up faint energy spikes out here. You may have some visitors coming over, prep the welcoming committee.
40683	Picking up com chatter..they appear to be looking for something. Explains why we don't have their full attention yet.
40684	Our smaller crafts may as well be target drones for those Kadeshi ships. Recommend fielding additional Brigand and Thief Corvettes to increase our anti-strikecraft capabilities.
40685	Defend the Fleet
40686	We are under attack by Kadeshi units. Work together with our escort fleet to protect our Capital Ships.
40687	..the hell is happening..?! What are these things?! Get--(*KRRRRRRR*)
40688	Rebuild the Fleet
40689	The loss of our Escort Fleet has left us crippled. Fall back to one of the nearby resource deposits and rebuild the fleet. 
40691	Secure the Anomaly
40692	The Kadeshi and Hiigaran fleets went to great lengths to find this anomaly. Track down the source of its signal and secure it.
40693	Unknown Vessel
40694	Send a Siege Drill Frigate to board the vessel
40695	The derelict vessel is about to go critical. We're running out of time.
40696	Readings suggest the derelict vessel will self-destruct in 2 minutes. We must neutralize our Cruiser and get out of here!
40697	Detonation is imminent, we're out of time! All hands return to ship, return to-
40698	ETA until area explosion: %1MINUTES%:%2SECONDS% 
40699	Sensors indicate multiple enemy signatures changing course to the derelict vessel. Raider signatures maintaining course and approaching us. Use this opportunity to neutralize our Cruiser. 
40700	
40701	Neutralize the HeavyGun Cruiser
40702	Capture or Destroy our former Escort Cruiser. It must be neutralized to escape the alien vessel's self-destruct.\n\n<b>Tip:</b> Units using [Heavy Weapons] will be able to take advantage of its solid armor.
40703	Keep your eyes open for our Cruiser. It is slow, but powerful. Bombers and Minefields may give us the edge needed to topple it.
40704	Neutralize the HeavyGun Cruiser
40705	Capture or Destroy our former Escort Cruiser. It must be neutralized to escape the alien vessel's self-destruct.\n\n<b>Tip:</b> Units using [Heavy Weapons] will be able to take advantage of its solid armor.
40706	The cruiser has been destroyed, the hyperspace dampening field is disappearing. The derelict vessel is in deep red and will take down the remaining ships with it. All hands, standby for immediate hyperspace .. let's go home.
40707	MISSION FAILED
40708	MISSION COMPLETE
40709	Turanic Salvage Fleet
40710	Escort Fleet
40711	Kadeshi Scavengers
40712	Hiigaran Fleet
40713	Derelict
40714	Heavy Gun Cruiser
40715	%d Kadeshi Fleet Found
40716	%d Hiigaran Arrival
40717	%d Escort Fleet Lost
40718	Terminating comms now, we'll check back when we need you to haul their debris back to base. 
40719	We appear to be out of their sensor range for now. But it is only a matter of time until they find us.
40720	This is an uncharted sector of space. We must remain vigilant.
40721	Analysis complete. Our ships were taken over by some sort of automated AI defense mechanism. After studying the visuals, researching believes the derelict ships to be some type of Progenitor Mover variant.
40722	It is their opinion that these Movers run a static charge through the hull of a ship upon contact. With the vessel incapitated, an AI is then uploaded into its control systems to reconfigure them and take control.
40723	Warning! We have lost all contact with our escorts .. more enemy signatures inbound, we must get out of here!
40724	Recommend immediate retreat to this position. Now go!
40725	Pursue the Escort Fleet
40726	Your Carrier has diverted all power to engines in an attempt to keep up with the rogue escort fleet. Protect it.
40727	The cruiser has been destroyed .. we can now hyperspace out. Maybe things could have been different, but .. all hands, standby for emergency hyperspace exit. Let's go home.
40728	Move your Attack Carrier here
40729	We have been able to further narrow down the source of the anomalous signal. Sensor grid updated.
40730	Analyze the Data
40731	[Research] the data from our Scouts to deduct what happened to our escort fleet.
40732	We have also learned of a large Progenitor site that lays beyond this area. The Capture Movers we encountered safeguard the passage, bolstering their ranks with anything that comes too close. Maybe we can-
40733	Uhh..Captain? We have a problem here..some sort of system on the derelict vessel suddenly flared to life..it has activated a self-destruct sequence! We are vacating it as we speak.
40734	We can't just leave our Cruiser out there. We must try to capture it before the derelict vessel explodes, or destroy it to re-enable our Hyperspace Drive if we can't. 
40735	"HeavyBoss"
