  	text = [[A man named Sajuuk predicted that after a long and devastating civil war, the Progenitor civilization would be destroyed, and it was likely that the survivors would return to a very low level of civilization. In order to rebuild the Progenitor civilization after the war, he organized a group of like-minded people to start a civilization rescue plan called "Spark". According to the plan, they hid the battleship of Sajuuk in the depths of Balcora, then stored information about the Progenitor civilization into its engine system - the three hyperspace cores, and then hid them in three different locations in the galaxy. If future generations can redevelop space technology and find these hyperspace cores, they will be able to get part of the records and lessons from the Progenitors. And who collects the three hyperspace cores will be able to restart the battleship of Sajuuk and obtain a complete knowledge of the Progenitors＊ history, technology and wisdom from the ship's database. On their way to Balcora, they kept sending their crew members down to any planet suitable for human habitation in the hope that they could reproduce on these planets, escape the war and rebuild civilization.

Sajuuk was regarded as a traitor because he broke away from his original faction for the Spark plan. Some others heard of the Spark plan and knew that he had hidden a latest warship and wanted to seize it. So Sajuuk and his friends were chased after and attacked by many different factions. During those battles, the shipyard that built the battleship of Sajuuk was destroyed, with debris scattered throughout the galaxy. Two dreadnoughts which were used as guides to open the door to Sajuuk were also missing.

Finally, Sajuuk completed his plan. The Progenitors eventually dried up their last drop of blood, and the whole civilization went back to the lowest stage. Some people were trapped on the planets and returned to primitive society. Some people were trapped in the space stations or space ships; while they could still access and use these high-tech products, they lost their science and technology, and they only know how to use, but not how to develop those products. The crew members of Sajuuk who were sent down during the way to Balcora were not able to escape the scourge of the war, and survivors from them also returned to the primitive society.

Some Progenitors tried to save the civilization in another way, called the "Soul Project". They quantized their bodies and stored them in a database in the hope of preserving their memories and knowledge and rebuilding the glorious civilization in the future.

Before the destruction of the Progenitor civilization, some people finally discovered the action of TMAT. They drove them back to the companion galaxy with the last breath of strength, then closed the Eye of Aarran. They also build two artificial planets beside the Eye of Aarran, named the Great Wall and the Hadrian, as the guardians and barriers to prevent the TMAT from bringing disasters after the destruction of the Progenitor civilization, and also to prevent their descendants from rashly reopening the Eye of Aarran and bringing their enemies. (However, Sajuuk didn't know about this last effort, so in his plan, if their descendants find the battleship of Sajuuk, they should restart the Eye of Aarran to reopen the transportation network and prosper in the galaxy. We will soon see what consequences would this have for the second generation of civilization.)

With the help of the Progenitors, the Bentusi eventually drove the TMATs away. Since then, the Progenitor civilization had collapsed. As loyal friends and worshippers of their the Progenitors, the Bentusi has made up their minds to help the Progenitor＊s descendants rise again.

They happened to find one of the three hyperspace cores of Sajuuk and mounted it on the Bentus. ]]

  	text = [[Since then, more than two thousand years have passed.

The descendants of the Progenitors had forgotten their previous civilization. They had gone through the ages of blood, slavery and feudalism, muskets and steam, gas engines and electronics on their own planet, or they had been driving their ancestors' high-tech machines with ignorant minds in spaceships and space stations. Sajuuk became their legendary god or demon (depending on which Progenitors faction they were descended from); the three hyperspace cores to rediscover the Progenitor civilization became "the one who collects the three holy things will become the Sajuuk-Khar - the Chosen One"; the restart of the battleship of Sajuuk also became the myth of "Sajuuk will return to the world". Some anti-Sajuuk Progenitors believed that Sajuuk hid his warship to launch a strategic counter-attack and defeat them, so their descendants have formed such a legend that "Sajuuk's return will bring the doomsday and catastrophes."

During this period, the Bentusi adhered to the principles of the Progenitors and did not contact them.

Until one day, the descendants of the Progenitors on planets invented their own rockets and flew into space; the descendants of the Progenitors on spaceships no longer treated the ship as a fetich and started inventing and creating by themselves. Bentusi then began visiting them one by one, bringing back the knowledge of hyperspace they learned from the Progenitors. Forgetting the history of their ancestors, people just thought the Bentusi was a high-tech alien race, and this historical event is called "Bentusi Arrival".

Later, the descendants of the Progenitors returned to the galaxy as "different civilizations".

For 500 years, people lived in peace under the glory of Bentusi. But with the development of technology and the enlargement of people＊s vision, they started an uprising against Bentusi. This part of history is detailed in the appendix of the official Homeworld 2 booklet.

The descendants of the Progenitors thought each other as aliens and different species and civilizations. They call themselves Taiidani, Hiigarans, Charazers, Fronians, Red-Rings, and so on.

After the Hiigarans were exiled to Kharak, what happened was the plot of Homeworld 1. The second hyperspace core was discovered on Kharak, and the Hiigarans returned to their homeworld, Hiigara.

Thereafter, the Taiidan Empire was overthrown, and the Republic of Taiidan was founded. But the greedy Galactic Council had always wanted to obliterate the Taiidan world, and the Hiigrans also wanted to take back the territory that the Taiidani had taken from their ancestors after knowing the history of their past empire. Later, the cataclysm of beast broke out. Although the whole galaxy finally survived the cataclysm, the political situation became worse and worse. Finally, the war broke out, which was called "the Dust War". In the Dust War, the Galactic Council was disintegrated, and every country was at war with each other. People recall the old myth and also call the Dust War "War of the End Time", which is also considered the Galaxy War III. (the Galaxy War I was the war when every race was trying to expand but was suppressed by the Bentusi by force. Followed by Galaxy War was a period of peace for hundreds of years. Then came the Galaxy War II, which is also called "Pan-Galaxy Uprising", during which several major races launched wars at the same time in different parts of the Galaxy. After this war, Bentusi＊s control over the galaxy was loosened; the Galactic Council was founded, and Bentusi＊s influence over the galaxy was limited in commerce.) The Hiigrans took advantage of this opportunity and began to devour the space of the Taiidani world. The political structure of the Taiidani Republic, which was never stabilized, had been shaking gradually and finally collapsed. At this time, a minority of ethnic group in Taiidani territory called Vaygr appeared on the stage of history under the slogan of "Unify the Taiidani World."]]

Before Makaan was killed at Balcora, he told Karan part of the progenitors' history, his real identity and the threat of TMATs.

With the victory of the legendary "War of the End", and becoming the fabled "Sajuuk-Khar - the Chosen One", the self-satisfaction and pride of Hiigarans began to swell, and they began to declare that " The Age of S'jet has begun."

When they just defeated the Vaygr, Hiigaran had the highest prestige in the galaxy. Many races and nations stood beside Hiigaran in the hope of bringing peace to the galaxy. However, as time went on, the "sense of obligation" in Hiigarans＊ mind, which had been at a reasonable level, expanded to a "sense of superiority". With the Celestial Star stirring up the flames, the Hiigarans began to think that all other races＊ inability to resist the Vaygr can prove that Hiigaran civilization and culture are the best in the galaxy. All the myths have been realized in their hands, so the galaxy should be unified under the leadership of Hiigaran. All ※good§ races in the galaxy should follow the trend, learn from Hiigaran culture, act by Hiigaran code of conduct, and enter the international order advocated by Hiigarans. Therefore, the Great Unified Galaxy Organization was established, whose purpose was to assimilate the whole galaxy with Hiigaran lifestyle and ideas.

Inevitably, the Hiigarans began to demand that other races should adopt Hiigaran ways of thinking, moral standards, and codes of conduct; otherwise, they would be reprimanded as dissidents, scoundrels, and villains.

As a result, Hiigarans＊ image among the various races in the galaxy began to deteriorate, and Hiigarans＊ action to unify the galaxy was greatly hindered. More and more frequently, they used force to oppress others to yield to them. This kind of imperialist hegemonism aroused people's disgust, which was used by the mysterious "Progenitor souls" in different nations to incite dissatisfaction with Hiigara, and finally turned into a revolt. Under the interpretation of the Celestial Star, the rebellion was regarded by the Hiigarans as an alien nationalism ideology and was further suppressed, which further intensified the contradictions.]]

Because Karan had gone dormant in the hyperspace core, people could not take her off the Sajuuk, and no one else could take her place. Thus people could not release the full power of the three cores of the Sajuuk. However, according to the scientists and engineers of the Great Unified Galaxy Organization, it is not necessary to exert the full power of the three cores to open the Eye of Aarran.

But the problem was that there were two defensive planets near the Eye of Aarran - the Great Wall and the Hadrian, which would attack anyone if they approached.

Later, as the war with the Galaxy Rescue Alliance tightened, the proposal to open the Eye of Aarran was brought up again. The Hiigarans could not make full use of Sajuuk, as its strategic jumping ability which was enough to change the outcome of the war could not be exerted. The Hiigaran army was at the crucial juncture in the face of its superior enemies. At this time, their only hope was the Eye of Aarran, which, as said by Karan before she went to hibernation, could help people travel to anywhere in the galaxy.

The Hiigarans spent a lot of effort, blew up the two defensive planets, and then opened the Eye of Aarran.

However, before the Hiigarans began to use the Eye of Aarran, the TMATs in the companion galaxy had discovered that the Eye of Aarran was reopened and their army swarmed in. Fortunately, after opening the Eye of Aarran, the Sajuuk was transferred to the front line to solve the crisis there, which saved it from being captured by the TMAT army.

After the TMATs rushed into the galaxy, they quickly contacted the electronic lives and learned the situation which the electronic lives had prepared. Because the Sajuuk was still in Hiigarans＊ hands, the TMATs still had scruples. They followed the plan of electronic lives and said to the Great Unified Galaxy Organization that they were the livings from the companion galaxy, and had been friends and loyal allies of the Progenitors; because the evil Bentusi sealed the Eye of Aarran, they were unable to help when the Progenitor civilization was destroyed. Now since the Eye of Aarran was reopened, and the evil Bentusi was organizing an army to destroy the Hiigarans who were the Chosen One by the Progenitors, they would help Hiigaran selflessly.

The arrival of TMAT gave the Great Unified Galaxy Organization a chance. The TMAT put forward the strategy of "soldiers versus soldiers, generals versus generals": Their technology level is comparable to Bentusi's, so they can deal with Bentusi and the counterfeit Progenitor ships made by Bentussi, while the Hiigaran deals with the betrayed descendants of the Progenitors. The reason why the TMAT did so is to ensure the balance of power between the two factions in the war. They made the Great Unified Galaxy Organization and the Galaxy Rescue Alliance consume each other, while their fleet, the fake Bentusi fleet, and the phony Progenitor fleet pretended to be fighting fiercely without real effort. When the descendants of the Progenitor dried up their last drop of blood, the TMAT could sit and enjoy it.

But that was not what people call it at that time. The Alliance called it "the War Against Hegemony", while the Organization called it "the Unification War".

The Alliance's attacks on Hiigaran central region through Taiidani territory and attacks on the Kadesh had significantly hampered the strength of the Organization. Although in the beginning, the two sides still showed a state of balance of power, over time, the Hiigaran army, which was facing enemies from different directions, began to show signs of fatigue. As they were the backbone of the Organization, once Hiigaran was at a disadvantage, the morale of the Organization started to decline dramatically. The Organization had always been hoping their TMAT friends could help, but the TMATs rejected the request for reinforcement on the grounds that "the evil Bentusi is too strong so they have no spare army to help the Organization."

To stop this decline of morale, Hiigaran had quickened the search for "the Treasure of Bentusi".

"The Treasure of Bentusi" was a legend that had been told in the galaxy for a long time. It was said that Bentusi hid their technology and wealth somewhere in the galaxy. When Bentusi was still alive, they neither confirmed nor denied such legends. After the extinction of Bentusi, some adventurers began to search for it, but more people laughed at it and were busy recovering the destruction of the Dust War and the War of the End.

There is only one exception, and that was Hiigaran. While they were busy recovering from wars, promoting their ideology, seeking to reunite different races, and researching the Eye of Aarran, they also sent people to every corner of the galaxy to search for Bentusi's treasure. The reason why they were so enthusiastic about this legend was that they knew it was not just a ridiculous rumor - they know Bentusi did leave something behind. The reason was that during the War of the End, before the explosion of the Mother Harbour Bentus, the ship sent a message to the Pride of Hiigara: "the future of the past, where the heritage lies - the end of the stars, the beginning of life; the end of the home, the beginning of memory." The meaning is clear enough: the Bentusi did leave a legacy, and they clearly told Hiigaran where it was. 〞 Yes, for those Bentusi who always spoke unclearly like a fortune teller, that is already very "clear".

Thus, Hiigara had been secretly sending personnel to find "the end of the stars, the beginning of life; the end of the home, the beginning of memory". As for the first sentence, "the future of the past", was understood as the glorious technology of Bentusi in the past would have an impact on the future development of Hiigara. They had used up their imagination and went to all the places of suspect, but it was not in the galactic halo, not in the galactic corona, nor in the Eye of Aarran which was in the center of the galaxy.

With the unfolding of the War of Sibling Rivalry, the search for Bentusi's treasure gradually stopped. However, since Hiigara was at a disadvantage faced attacks from different directions, and the TMAT refused to provide assistance, as a drowning man will clutch at a straw, people re-started the search for the treasure of Bentusi, hoping to get a new force and change the war again, just like the last time when the TMAT came.]]

  	title = "The Only Hope",
  	text = [[The distance between failure and the Organization was getting shorter and shorter. The attack forces of the Alliance had pushed the front line to a distance of only two light-years from Hiigara.

Hiigara finally sent the Sajuuk to the front line, but it could not change the war in essence. Because Karan went dormant in the hyperspace core control center, people could not exert the power of the warship without full control of the cores, the appearance of the Sajuuk only influenced the morale of soldiers of both sides a bit at the beginning. When it was discovered that the Sajuuk did not show the expected power, even this influence quickly receded. The tide of war continued to flood into Hiigara, ready to push it into the bottom of the ocean and make it disappear from history.

Just at this time, a Hiigaran gunship which had disappeared on the front line in Kadesh entered the headquarters of the Diamid under the protection of the Hiigaran fleet. The gunship carried the hope of survival of all Hiigarans and the entire Organization - they brought back something from the "Treasure of Bentusi".

It turned out that the gunship had been lost in the scuffle in support of the Kadashi, and had entered the chaotic zone where there were Vaygrs, Tiidanis and Turanic Raiders active. The crew kept hiding from place to place until they finally repaired their gunship and got enough fuel to begin to return to Hiigara. In the course of returning, the unlucky crew once again got lost and came to an uncharted planet.

The planet had lost almost two-fifths of its body, and the rest had turned into a huge, ugly rock.

The crew had thought there was no life in this region, but when they came closer, they found ships of TMAT, the Progenitors and Bentusi orbiting around the planet. The gunboat hid into the dark side of the planet. Since then, they had continued to find ships seemingly from these three different factions patrolling here. It was a miracle that gunship could enter the inner space of the planet without anyone noticing them.

This is an extraordinary situation.  Whether from the standpoint of the Organization or the Alliance, the TMAT, Bentusi and those unmanned Progenitor ships are absolute enemies to each other, but here they lived and acted together peacefully.

The gunship crew ventured down to the surface of the planet. After a covert reconnaissance, the crew found out that the TMATs were searching something here. And they also saw a "Bentusi" getting off a Bentusi spacecraft - the halo around him disappeared, and he turned out to be a TMAT.

The crew sneaked into the excavation site of TMATs, and then found a secret chamber under their continuing extreme luck. Inside the secret chamber, the crew found the answer to the mystery. This dead planet is Bentus, the birthplace of the Bentusi thousands of years ago. The TMAT were coming here to discover the "Treasure of Bentusi".

In fact, the reason why these ordinary Hiigaran soldiers had such good luck had always been the help of Jakuul. Although his primary focus was on the database of TMAT, he also made some efforts to secretly change the course of the gunship and protecting them to approach the Treasure of Bentusi without anyone noticed.

The Treasure of Bentusi - a vast database - showed them all the truth behind history. After the initial shock, these Hiigarans began their mission. The storage devices they brought with them could not store all the scientific and historical data here, and it is not feasible for them to venture back and forth to copy all data back to the spaceship. They only have the opportunity to take away some of the treasures. Finally, the captain decided to abandon the scientific and technological data and take historical records!

With the secret help of Jakuul, the Hiigaran gunship escaped safely from the blockade of TMAT ships in three different styles, despite a large number of enemies pursuing behind it.

After entering the line of defense of Hiigara, the gunship briefed the situation to the Diamid immediately. Although Diamid was equally shocked, they quickly decided to order the fleet to do their best to protect the gunship back to Hiigara; as for the TMAT ships behind it, avoided fighting with them until the truth was clear; but the fleet needed to try to prevent them from following the gunship. If the TMAT started firing, they should counterattack immediately.

When the TMAT approached the line of defense of Hiigara, they withdrew both the "Bentusi ships" and "Progenitor ships", allowing only the TMAT-style ships enter the Hiigarans' vision. Faced with those neither humble nor arrogant Hiigarans who would not step back a foot, the TMATs decided to take off their mask of hypocrisy, because if the gunship published the truth recorded by Bentusi to the whole galaxy, all the lies they told before would be exposed, and then they would need to fight with Hiigarans anyway. They would like to destroy all evidence now when only Hiigarans knew the truth.

Hiigara was now in more danger. In addition to the Alliance, the fake Bentusi and the fake Progenitors, they now had another strong enemy - the TMAT. Even allies in the Organization were angry at Hiigara, thinking the Hiigarans must have done something wrong to bring the attacks of TMAT.

When Diamid showed their allies the records of truth from the Treasure of Bentusi, everyone was both angry and happy. The anger was that they and the Alliance had been deceived into killing each other by the TMAT - the criminal back from the time of Progenitors; The joy was that they are really brothers of the Alliance, and as long as the truth is published, the critical situation on the front line could be reversed in one fell swoop. All people of the same blood should put aside their prejudices, which are entirely instigated by the enemy, and unite against their real enemy.

The Organization began to work together to resist the attack of the TMAT and sent out the message of reconciliation to the Alliance, while also desperately broadcasting the truth of the treasure of Bentusi to every direction in the galaxy.

However, what made the Organization heartbreak is that the Alliance refused to accept the "so-called truth" from the Organization.]]

This is because they have been onlookers during the War of Sibling Rivalry. They had been developing silently and preserving their power; and because they had been keeping away from the international politics, and Queen Scandina intuitively refused the help of those "Progenitors souls", less electronic lives had infiltrated into Taiidani military and government departments. Thus, after the explosion of "bombs" and "embryos", the Taiidani army had the least "mutinies" in the galaxy.

In the Bloody Million-Second Battle, the Taiidani were in the bloodiest parts of the battlefield - the perimeter of the Sajuuk and the middle defense line. After decades of endurance and humiliation, the heroism and courage of the ancient Eight-Banner Taiidani Fleets have reappeared in today's Taiidani. The Taiidani had bought much time in the face of the more technologically advanced TMATs. However, human's initiative is not omnipotent, and the defense line of Taiidan was on the edge of collapse. The innermost defense line was established by the remnants of the Organization and the Alliance. If the TMATs broke through here, they could only launch kamikaze attacks.

At this critical moment, the TMATs suddenly suspended their attacks. Taiidani, the Organization, and the Alliance immediately re-organized their defense line, and at the same time sent scouts to the back of enemy to see what happened. The mystery was solved: a Turanic Raiders fleet were attacking TMATs on the other side of the battlefield. But it was not enough to hold back TMATs if it was just the Raiders. And soon people found the answer of the mystery behind the mystery: followed by the Raiders was a fleet of Bentusi!

These Bentusi ships were not the fake ones made by the TMATs, but authentic and genuine Bentusi vessels! And unlike the Bentusi ships which people had been familiar with,  they all have offensive weapons!

Here's how the story began:

As early as more than a hundred years ago, out of fear of the Beast, the Bentusi had planned to move the whole race into other galaxies. After the first few ships left, the Kuun-Lan fleet of Kiith Somtaaw persuaded the Bentusi to change their mind to stay in the galaxy and fight against the Beast together.

Even the Progenitors who had such advanced technology could not jump to another galaxy directly. For thousands of years, Bentusi had been collecting the high-tech relics of the Progenitors, which had brought them some technological progress, but they were still far from the level of the Progenitors. Thus the jump gate Bentusi wanted to use to jump to other galaxies was a rather immature product. Although it could provide enough energy to let ships jump far enough, people could not control the jump destination at all. That is to say, whether the other side of the gate was another galaxy or the void in the universe was utterly uncontrollable. If it weren't because Bentusi was frightened out of their minds by the Beast, they would never try to use such a device.

That is to say, the first few Bentusi ships could not come back, and where they went was unknown. A group of Bentusi volunteered to enter the gate to search for the missing ships. The volunteers jumped away, and the other Bentusi did not expect to see them back. In the War of the End Time, the Bentusi in our Galaxy became extinct.

Fortunately, the volunteers jumped into another galaxy and found several missing ships. Although there were still some ships missing, the volunteers were still happy.

These Bentusi planned to go back to our galaxy. When the volunteers set out from our galaxy, they brought with some outstanding scientists and engineers to find a way home after finding their compatriots.

The built another stargate. Though there was no guarantee that they would be lucky enough to jump back home immediately, they decided to bet with probability. But they couldn't find enough energy to launch it. They thought of black holes. The fleet went to the core of that galaxy and ready to use the energy of the black holes there to launch the gate. However, after reaching the center of the galaxy, they found some massive debris of space ships that could rival the remains of the Progenitors.

Strangely, the wreckage was painted in a typical Turanic Raiders style. After a preliminary survey, the oddity turned into shock: the debris, apart from its different appearance, had all the same technical standards as the early technology of the Progenitors!]]

  	text = [[Out of respect and curiosity for the Progenitors, the Bentusi decided to settle down for a while and take a closer look at the wreckage and tried to find why they had become wreckage.

Repeated investigations confirmed that these ships must have a very close relationship with the Progenitors. But they couldn't know what had happened to such a huge fleet. The Bentusi also found some relics on the sizeable surrounding debris, in which there were signs of both high and low technology, just like those Progenitor relics where crews in space ships had survived the collapse of civilization but had retrograded to primitive society. According to the Bentusi's analysis, these compatriots of Progenitors had also experienced a great regression of civilization, so their descendants left on the space ships had retrograded to primitive civilization. But the evidence of activity of this primitive civilization had stopped after some time. Some traces of them activation pointed to the black holes in the center of this galaxy.

Careful astronomical analyses showed that there are several tiny wormholes in this black hole cluster.

In general, the Bentusi's guess was not far from the truth. These Raider-style ships did come from the same place as the Progenitors. They were both space exploration fleets, but with different destinations. This fleet came here through the central wormhole of the galaxy. (In a sense, the Eye of Aarran is also an artificial wormhole.) However, some kind of disaster had happened to them, and their civilization collapsed and retrograded to primitive society. For their descendants, the history of coming here from their homeland through the wormhole had become a myth. The harsh environment here stimulated them to venture back to the wormhole, trying to find a way back to the home in their legend. But they did not have the technology to explore wormholes, and their only clues were some vague descriptions in the legend. Most of their expedition fleets had jumped to nowhere, but one of them jumped out of a tiny wormhole in the Turanic region in our galaxy and had been called the Turanic Raiders since then.

The Bentusi began to believe that one of these wormholes must lead to our galaxy, and they started trying. To avoid separation from other fleet members again, they kept exploring together and examined the wormholes one by one. They had been to many different galaxies, but none of them was our galaxy, and they didn't meet any intelligent being. They traveled through these new galaxies, came back through the same wormhole and then tried the next wormhole. In this way, it took them more than a hundred years to return to our galaxy.

The Bentusi fleet jumped out in the Turanic region. After finding out where they jumped out, they confirmed their guess - they solved the mystery of the origin of the Turanic Raiders!

However, the joy of returning home did not last long. The Bentusi found their race had been extinct here, and the cruel TMAT, whom they had not seen for a long time, were attacking the descendants of the Progenitors. (This is the time when TMAT just broke with Hiigarans and began their conquering of the whole galaxy.)

The Turanic Raiders found these Bentusi. The Bentusi told them the long-lost history of their origins with detailed archaeological data. In modern times, there had been two different parties of Turanic people: one of them thought they were not a race of this galaxy, and should not participate much in the politics of the galaxy, and this is the guiding ideology of the inner-Turanic; the other party thought since they had already forgotten where their home was and had no way to go home, they should just live here and treat themselves as a member of the society of the galaxy, and this is the guiding ideology of the outer-Turanic. Except for the previous invasion to the Taiidan territory and the later self-defense against the Vaygr, they tried their best to stay away from galactic affairs, especially during the War of Sibling Rivalry. However, the evidence brought back by the Bentusi made it clear that they are not really "raiders", but brothers with the same blood of the other races in this galaxy.

The pride of learning about their ancient history excited all the Turanic people, and they wanted to go out and fight alongside their brothers immediately. But the Bentusi told them to put it on hold.

This was not because the Bentusi would forgive the crimes of TMAT. On the contrary, their philosophy of "adherence" to the descendants of Progenitors had been their core code of conduct for thousands of years, for which they did not even care about their survival. However, the power of the Turanic people alone would not solve any problems. Although Bentusi's technology was comparable to, or even slightly beyond, that of TMAT, none of their ships had offensive weapons. Their defensive weapons were useful facing opponent of lower technology, but almost useless to someone like TMAT.

As a result, the Bentusi made their decision: they decided to break their promise of never using weapons again. Four thousand years ago, they solemnly vowed never to use weapons again because their guns had deeply hurt the descendants of Progenitors (that was when they defeated the old Hiigaran Empire and caused the Kushan been exiled by the Taiidani). But today, to defend the blood of Progenitors, they were willing to break their vows! The reason why they stop the immediate actions of Turanic people is that they were equipping their ships with weapons that had not been touched in thousands of years, and they were also helping Turanic people to modify their ships with high-tech devices.

Seeing that the Organization and the Alliance were on the edge of death under the attack of the TMATs and the rebels, the Bentusi had to finish their equipping of weapons hastily and began their attacks from the region of Turanic.

The surprise attack caused some chaos for the TMATs at the beginning, and the return of the real Bentusi made the TMATs uneasy. But as the TMAT fleet turned back and began to battle with Bentusi, the Bentusi started to fail because of their unfinished weapon systems.

In spite of the increasing pressure, the Bentusi were fighting fearlessly. The hostility between the two races from nearly ten thousand years ago made TMATs use up all their main forces on the siege of the Bentusi, and even highest flagship of TMAT named the Black Blood of TMAT, which just moved to the battlefield from the companion galaxy, had joined the siege.

However, no matter how brave and unyielding a lonely tiger is, it can not withstand the attacks of a team of wolves. Three thousand seconds before Karen woke up, the last Bentusi ship in the universe collided with the Black Blood of TMAT and died with the imperator of their foe.

Bentusi, the kind native race of the galaxy, had been keeping their adherence and protecting all races in the galaxy for thousands of years, all driven by their thankfulness to their friend and teacher - the Progenitors. When the last Bentusi lost their life in the explosion, did they feel satisfied with the selfless history of their race? Did they blame themself for failing to stop the TMAT completely? Was they feeling happy to be able to die with their enemy, or worrying about whether the civilization of Progenitors would finally survive this ordeal?

Once upon a time, it was thought that the Bentusi in this galaxy was extinct. Now, there is no such race in the whole universe...

Ironically, however, the end of the race of Bentusi was also the opening of the finale of another native race - the TMAT.]]

Karan S'jet, the miraculous woman who really became "the Chosen One" after numerous and disorderly interactions, transformations, and interferences among masses of mathematical variables in history, ended the mysterious journey of the quantum state and opened her eyes.

People and Karan did not have time to greet each other or even discuss the battle plan. Karan took all the command of Sajuuk and began to rescue the human from the crisis.

Karan showed the world the real strength of the Sajuuk, the masterpiece of progenitors. This strength is not a huge hull and heavy armor, not even a terrifying gun and unlimited long-range jumping capability, but a very different way of fighting: hyperspace jumping warfare! Whether the Bentusi, TMATs, or the descendants of progenitors, they all jump once and fight in the normal space. Under the control of Karan, who had learned the basic battle skills and techniques of progenitors, the Sajuuk made full use of the energy of three hyperspace cores. Employing hundreds of artillery shelling within each moment between dozens of jumps per second, in a few minutes, the Sajuuk swept out the 100 light-years thick enclosure of TMATs, creating more than a dozen areas with no living creatures. As the opponent, TMAT could not observe and calculate the number of jumps made by Sajuuk, let alone predict where it would jump in advance. More often than not, their ships just blew up after the perception of a flash of bright light, and before the light could even hit the ships＊ armor, the Sajuuk has attacked another ship several light-years away.

This attacking method, which goes beyond all the concepts of time and space, is the standard mode of operation during the civil war of progenitors. At that time, this kind of battle happened everywhere in the galaxy. The warships of both sides flickered and disappeared in space. Each flicker was a jump. Each flicker was accompanied by tens of millions of different types of attacks. Some spacecraft could jump more than ten light-years in the short period between they getting shot and exploding. The fighting intensity and pattern of Bentusi, TMAT and the descendants are the same level as the game played between naughty juvenile children of progenitors driving a second-hand private spacecraft.

TMATs' siege of the largest human cluster centered on Hiigara was thus defused. The Sajuuk, on the one hand, led the main army in its search for the main forces of TMATs. On the other hand, it used the passive jumping function of unlimited distance to continuously transmit the fleet to the planets that might still have survivors to rescue them. Unfortunately, there is only one such warship powered by hyperspace core. Even if in best cases, it can not solve all the problems in the whole galaxy at the same time. The surviving fleet of descendants also has to undertake heavy tasks to fight against the TMAT fleet. ]]

  	text = [[Thanks to the struggle of the crew of Sajuuk and the descendants of progenitors, TMATs now holds only their last important stronghold, the Eye of Aarran. Military forces of the descendants among the entire galaxy are about to cross the Eye of Aarran and enter the companion galaxy. However, TMATs were not so easy to admit defeat and could not tolerate the entry of other races into the companion galaxy, so an idea came into being: to blow up the Eye of Aarran.

Facing the crazy TMATs, no one can stop the tragedy. The Eye of Aarran, the great miracle of the progenitors, was destroyed by the suicide attack of TMATs. Although it did not completely explode, the fragmented structure could not be repaired unless the descendants reproduced the glorious technology of progenitors.

The war that stirred up the whole galaxy ended in a way that did not really make people feel comfortable. Anyway, the descendants have united again, inspired by the glorious history of progenitors, and radiate infinite enthusiasm, not only to repair the wounds of war but also to reproduce the great glory of progenitors. Despite concerns about how long this unity can be maintained without external pressures by the long-separated and antagonistic descendants, at least it is still an ideal era. Under the leadership of Karan S'jet, a direct descendant of progenitors, people are fully enjoying the warmth of the great harmony of the galaxy. The attitude of the Kadashi towards the Hiigarans eased a bit, which made Hiigarans ecstatic; the Taiidans regained honor and self-confidence because of their heroic performance and outstanding contributions in the last bloody battle; the Turanic Raiders were also accepted by the whole galaxy, and they were reassuringly integrated into the galaxy, the word "outlander" became a historical term. All kinds of countries were disbanded, and the "Galactic Alliance of Progenitors' Blood " was established. People did not fear any enemies from the past, the present, and the future.

Finally, the Time of S'jet has come.]]
